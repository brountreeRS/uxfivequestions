            <p class="small margin-top-4 ae-2">The five questions process is designed to help me get a deeper understanding of what I need to be working on to best suppoort the efforts of the UX engineering team. I employ elements of NLP (neuro linguistic programming) in the meeting to get people thinking and visualizing the world when we're successful.</p>

            <p class="small margin-top-4 ae-4">Everywhere possible, I use the present tense and active mode as well as avoiding conditionals. "When I do all of that, what changes for you personally?" vs. "If I do all of that, what would change for you personally?" I will push you to visualize and live that moment as you are answering.</p>
            <p class="small margin-top-4 ae-6">I usually go into these with some sense of what concerns and issues are floating around out there, as well as what challenges we're going to face together. I've usually got a mental list of 1-3 points that I expect to hear as well as want to touch on.</p>

            <p class="ae-2">This is probably going to be the most constrained conversation you and I will ever have. I've got a kind of corny five question interview I like to use to give me a good sense of how I can best get started and help out the most. It's pretty straight forward:</span></p>

              <p class="ae-2">The rules for the 5 questions meeting are simple. I will never reveal what is said to me in the meeting, and you will answer the questions from a place of security that allows you to speak freely. Let me be clear here, I have no reason to think that there are a bunch of problems not being addressed in the team, and I am not looking to have these meetings become a place for people to unload. But even on the most successful teams, there are areas that can be improved upon and this process traditionally works well to help come up with meaningful work to make things better.</span></p>

Notes are stored on an encrypetd drive that never leaves my side. Company leadership will not hear or see any of this aside from a synthesized report I will build out of completely anonimized data.</p></li>
                      <li class="small col-6-12 left ae-5"><h3>Your Rule:</h3> <p class="small">Please be as open and honest with me as you are comfortable with. I realize that I am new, and you do not know me yet. That is why I go to the lengths I do to encrypt the data.</p></li>
